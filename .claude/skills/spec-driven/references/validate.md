# Execute: Validate & Verify

**Goal**: Verify implementation meets spec AND coding principles. This is NOT a separate phase — verification is part of every task's completion within Execute.

**Two levels of verification:**

1. **Per-task verification (always):** After implementing each task, verify its "Done when" criteria before committing. This is mandatory and automatic.

2. **Feature-level validation (on completion or on demand):** After all tasks for a feature (or priority group) are done, run a comprehensive validation. Includes acceptance criteria check, code quality review, and optionally interactive UAT.

**Interactive UAT is triggered when:** The feature has complex user-facing behavior where human judgment matters (UI flows, interaction patterns, visual design). For backend-only or infrastructure work, automated checks are sufficient.

**Trigger for explicit validation:** "Validate", "verify work", "UAT", "test with me", "walk me through it"

## Process

### 1. Check Completed Tasks

Go through tasks.md:

- [ ] All tasks marked done?
- [ ] Any blocked or partial?

### 2. Verify Acceptance Criteria

For each user story in spec.md:

```markdown
### P1: [Story Title]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. WHEN [X] THEN [Y] → [PASS/FAIL]
2. WHEN [X] THEN [Y] → [PASS/FAIL]
```

### 3. Check Edge Cases

From spec.md edge cases:

- [ ] [Edge case 1] handled correctly
- [ ] [Edge case 2] handled correctly

### 4. Run Build-Level Gate Check (MANDATORY)

Run the Build-level gate check from TESTING.md. This is NOT optional.

If TESTING.md does not exist (greenfield project), use the gate command agreed upon with the user during the Tasks phase.

1. Run: `[build gate command from TESTING.md, or the command agreed during planning]`
2. Non-zero exit code = STOP. Do not proceed to Code Quality Check.
3. Record results:
   - Total test count: [N]
   - Passed: [N]
   - Failed: [list]
   - Skipped: [list — each skip must be justified]

**Test Integrity Check:**

- Compare current test count against the count before this feature was implemented
- If test count DECREASED: investigate why. Tests should only be deleted with explicit justification.
- If assertions were weakened (less specific than before): flag as potential regression

### 5. Code Quality Check (MANDATORY)

For each changed file, verify against [coding-principles.md](coding-principles.md):

| Check                                | Pass? |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- |
| No features beyond what was asked    |       |
| No abstractions for single-use code  |       |
| No unnecessary "flexibility" added   |       |
| Only touched files required for task |       |
| Didn't "improve" unrelated code      |       |
| Matches existing patterns/style      |       |
| Would senior engineer approve?       |       |

❌ Any "No"? → Fix before marking complete.

### 6. Interactive UAT (if user-facing feature)

For each testable deliverable, present one test at a time:

```
Test [N]: [Test Name]

Expected: [What should happen — specific and observable]

→ Does this work? Describe what you see.
```

Wait for user response:

| User says                      | Interpret as            |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| "yes", "pass", "works", "next" | ✅ Pass                 |
| "skip", "can't test", "n/a"    | ⏭️ Skip                 |
| Anything else                  | ❌ Issue — log verbatim |

**Severity inference (never ask the user for severity):**

| User description contains               | Inferred severity |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| crash, error, exception, fails, broken  | Blocker           |
| doesn't work, wrong, missing, can't     | Major             |
| slow, weird, off, minor, small          | Minor             |
| color, font, spacing, alignment, visual | Cosmetic          |
| (unclear)                               | Major (default)   |

### 7. Generate Fix Plans (if issues found)

For each issue found during UAT:

1. **Diagnose** — Analyze the codebase to find root cause
2. **Create fix task** — Write a task definition with:
   - What: The specific fix
   - Where: File paths
   - Verify: How to prove the fix works
   - Done when: Acceptance criteria for the fix
3. **Present fix plan** — Show all fix tasks to user for approval

Fix tasks follow the same format as regular tasks and can be executed with the implement phase.

**Guardrail:** Maximum 3 diagnostic iterations per issue. If root cause isn't found after 3 attempts, flag for human investigation.

## Tips

- **P1 first** — MVP must work before P2/P3
- **WHEN/THEN = Test** — Each criterion is a test case
- **Be specific** — "Doesn't work" isn't helpful
- **Recommend fixes** — Don't just report problems, create fix tasks
- **Quality check is mandatory** — Not optional
- **Infer severity** — Never ask the user "how bad is this?"
- **Max 3 diagnostic iterations** — Prevents infinite investigation loops
- **Update traceability** — Every verified requirement updates spec.md status
